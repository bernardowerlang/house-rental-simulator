**Complete guide to use the simulator and understand the results**

---

## 🎯 Simulator Purpose

This simulator helps you decide the best way to tax your property rental income by comparing **Individual Person** (Progressive Tax) vs **Corporate** (Simplified Tax + Pro-labore). The goal is to maximize your final profit considering all taxes and costs involved.

---

## 📝 Filling Out the Data

### 📊 Basic Data

#### **💰 Gross Monthly Rent ($)**
- Monthly amount you plan to charge for rent
- **Example**: $1,500.00

#### **📅 Rental Duration (months)**
- How many months you plan to rent
- **Example**: 12 months

#### **📄 Total Number of Invoices (Corporate)**
- **Purpose**: Tax optimization strategy for Corporate
- **How it works**: By splitting total revenue across more invoices, you reduce the pro-labore amount per invoice, decreasing taxes
- **Example**: For $18,000 total revenue:
  - 1 invoice = 1x $18,000 (pro-labore of $5,040)
  - 4 invoices = 4x $4,500 (pro-labore of $1,260 each)
- **Tip**: Test different numbers to see the tax impact

#### **🏠 Total Alternative Housing Cost ($)**
- How much you'll spend on accommodation during the rental period
- **Includes**: Hotel, Airbnb, temporary rental, etc.
- **Example**: $7,200 ($600/month × 12 months)

### 💸 Costs and Deductions

#### **🔧 Monthly Property Fixed Costs ($/month)**
- Monthly fixed expenses you'll have even with the property rented
- **Includes**: Property tax, HOA fees, property insurance, basic maintenance
- **Example**: $350/month
- **⚠️ Important**: These costs are deducted from your profit in both regimes

#### **📋 Monthly Deductions ($/month) - Individual Only**
- Expenses that can be deducted in Individual Person tax filing
- **Includes**: Property tax, HOA fees, renovations, depreciation, brokerage expenses
- **Difference from fixed costs**: Deductions reduce the tax calculation base (greater savings)
- **Example**: $250/month
- **Tip**: Consult an accountant to know all possible deductions

#### **💰 Minimum Desired Profit ($)**
- Lowest profit you consider acceptable at the end of the period
- **Used in**: Viability analysis and negotiation assistant
- **Example**: $6,500

## 📊 Understanding the Results

### 🎯 Quick Summary

#### **Total Gross Revenue**
- Monthly rent × Number of months
- **Example**: $1,500 × 12 = $18,000

#### **Total Costs**
- Alternative housing + Property fixed costs for the period
- **Example**: $7,200 + ($350 × 12) = $11,400

#### **Before Taxes**
- Gross revenue - Total costs
- **Example**: $18,000 - $11,400 = $6,600

### 📈 Individual vs Corporate Comparison

#### **👤 Individual Person**
- **Tax Base**: Monthly rent - Monthly deductions
- **Tax**: Progressive tax table (2025)
- **Advantage**: Deductions can significantly reduce tax
- **Disadvantage**: Tax rates can be high for elevated amounts

- **Pro-labore**: 28% of total revenue divided by number of invoices
- **Pro-labore Taxes**: Social Security + Income Tax on each pro-labore
- **Advantage**: Fixed 6% rate + optimization with multiple invoices
- **Disadvantage**: Additional costs (accounting, company setup)
